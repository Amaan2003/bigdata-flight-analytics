# bigdata-flight-analytics

Built a scalable Big Data pipeline for flight status prediction using Hadoop, Spark, and Hive. Automated cluster setup on a VM and streamlined ETL workflows, including loading 12 months of flight data into HDFS, processing in Hive, and exporting cleaned data in CSV format.

Conducted EDA to analyze key factors affecting flight delays (weather, airport congestion, airline performance) and applied machine learning regression models for arrival and departure delay predictions. Developed a Tableau dashboard for visualizing flight trends and insights, enabling data-driven decision-making.

Technologies Used:
Big Data Processing: Hadoop, HDFS, Spark, PySpark

ETL & Storage: Hive, CSV

Machine Learning: Regression models for delay prediction

Data Visualization: Tableau, EDA

Automation & Deployment: VM, Shell Scripting
